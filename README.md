# Simple HTTP Reqeust and Response Interface
## Introduction
As a learning excercise, I wrote a simple way to interact with http requests and responses. Written before I researched and learned about PSR-7, so this definantly not compatable with the standard.
## Usage
The code is pretty well documented and usage can should be able to be infered from there. As I intend to write a PSR-7 standar compatable version, I will not really be documenting this other than there.
